## API

<!-- docks-start -->
_Generated using [docks](http://npm.im/docks)._

### [src/index.js](/src/index.js)

#### [charlike](/src/index.js#L43)
Scaffolds project with `name` and `desc` by
creating folder with `name` to some folder.
By default it generates folder with `name` to current
working directory (or `options.cwd`).
You can also define what _"templates"_ files to be used
by passing `options.templates`, by default it uses [./templates](./templates)
folder from this repository root.

**Params**
- `name` **{string}** project name
- `desc` **{string}** project description
- `[options]` **{object}** use `options.locals` to pass more context to template files,
                             use `options.engine` for different template engine to be used
                             in template files, or pass `options.render` function
                             to use your favorite engine

**Returns**
- `Promise<string>` if successful, resolved promise with absolute path to the project

**Examples**
```javascript
import charlike from 'charlike';

const opts = {
  cwd: '/home/charlike/code',
  templates: '/home/charlike/config/.jsproject',
  locals: {
    foo: 'bar',
    // some helper
    toUpperCase: (val) => val.toUpperCase(),
  },
};

charlike('my-awesome-project', 'some cool description here', opts)
  .then((dest) => console.log(`Project generated to ${dest}`))
  .catch((err) => console.error(`Error occures: ${err.message}; Sorry!`));
```
