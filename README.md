## API

<!-- docks-start -->
_Generated using [docks](http://npm.im/docks)._

### [src/index.js](/src/index.js)

#### [charlike](/src/index.js#L62)
Generates a complete project using a set of templates.

You can define what _"templates"_ files to be used
by passing `settings.templates`, by default it uses [./templates](./templates)
folder from this repository root.

You can define project metadata in `settings.project` object, which should contain
`name`, `description` properties and also can contain `repo` and `dest`.
By default the destination folder is dynamically built from `settings.cwd` and `settings.project.name`,
but this behavior can be changed. If `settings.project.repo` is passed, then it will be used
instead of the `settings.project.name`.

To control the context of the templates, pass `settings.locals`. The default set of locals
includes `version` string and `project`, `author` and `license` objects.

**Params**
- `settings` **{object}** the only required is `project` which should be an object
- `settings.cwd` **{object}** working directory to create project to, defaults to `process.cwd()`
- `settings.project` **{object}** should contain `name`, `description`, `repo` and `dest`
- `settings.locals` **{object}** to pass more context to template files
- `settings.engine` **{string}** for different template engine to be used in template files, default is `lodash`

**Returns**
- `Promise<object>` if successful, will resolve to object like `{ locals, project, dest, options }`

**Examples**
```javascript
import charlike from 'charlike';

const settings = {
  project: { name: 'foobar', description: 'Awesome project' },
  cwd: '/home/charlike/code',
  templates: '/home/charlike/config/.jsproject',
  locals: {
    foo: 'bar',
    // some helper
    toUpperCase: (val) => val.toUpperCase(),
  },
};

// the `dest` will be `/home/charlike/code/foobar`
charlike(settings)
  .then(({ dest }) => console.log(`Project generated to ${dest}`))
  .catch((err) => console.error(`Error occures: ${err.message}; Sorry!`));
```
